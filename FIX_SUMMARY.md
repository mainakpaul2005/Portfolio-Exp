#### **5. Error Handling - FIXED ✅**
- **Problem**: No error boundaries or proper error handling
- **Solution**: 
  - Created comprehensive `ErrorBoundary` component with fallback UI
  - Added loading components for better UX
  - Wrapped all main sections in error boundaries
  - Enhanced contact form error handling
  - Improved 404 page with better UX

#### **6. ESLint Errors - FIXED ✅**
- **Problem**: Unescaped apostrophes in JSX causing build failures
- **Solution**: Replaced all `'` with `&apos;` in JSX content

#### **7. Build Process - FIXED ✅**
- **Problem**: Build failing due to SSR issues and static generation errors
- **Solution**: 
  - Made problematic components client-only with dynamic imports
  - Fixed all window access issues
  - Build now passes successfully
